put all *test* files in a subfolder named "test".
in the main folder (where your files are), compile the project using the makefile.
change output.c time from 5.00 to 0.2 (for shorter waiting time)
do: chmod +x setup_server_tests
run: ./setup_server_tests
do: chmod +x run_test
run: ./run_test


i changed the test and removed the part that test average time (the test didnt worked for me and i dont have thew time to fix it)
and change things base on my understanding of the piazza so double check the result
